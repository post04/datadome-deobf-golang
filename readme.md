# Notes
1.) This only works for tags.js<br>
    - Everything but control flow flattening works on inter and captcha. (as of writing this)<br>
2.) This is fairly slow, especially the CFF part. Overall, it gets < 100ms deobf time on my machine, 71ms of which is CFF.
3.) This is not using default go-fast, it's using a custom fork which makes it easier to remove nodes.

# Bounty
50$ to anyone who can make a PR that makes this work (fix CFF) for inter and captcha as well. I know, 50$ isn't much, but if you want to contribute, there's a small incentive :)
